      "I am a highly accomplished IT infrastructure and virtualization specialist with over 7 years of experience in designing, optimizing, and securing enterprise-scale systems. Currently serving as a Senior IT and Network Admin at Kloudspot India, I lead critical initiatives across Linux server administration, multi-region networking, and compliance. My expertise spans achieving 99.9% uptime for 50+ Linux servers, architecting secure global networks via WireGuard VPN (reducing latency by 40%), and automating SSL renewals for 150+ devices to eliminate certificate outages.",
      "Previously at Zen & Art Infotek, I managed large-scale VMware environments, including 100+ ESXi hosts supporting 500+ VMs with 99.95% uptime. I optimized vSAN storage (cutting costs by 25%), streamlined HA/DRS operations, and resolved 95% of critical failures within SLA. My foundational role at OnProcess Technology honed my skills in enterprise ticketing, VMware/AD support, and Windows deployment, where I resolved 300+ monthly tickets while maintaining 95% SLA compliance."
